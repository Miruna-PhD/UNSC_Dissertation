# UNSC Dissertation

## This repository has the datasets and R code for my dissertation: "The UNeffect: Security Council Interventions in Cold War Armed Conflicts". It includes the dataset of the webscraped data on UN Security Council resolutions that were manually coded and appended to the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset and the final new dataset of UNSC Interventions in Armed Conflicts (both as time series and as conflict events).
